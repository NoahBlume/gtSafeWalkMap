# gtSafeWalkMap
Web app that uses GTPD's crime logs to show a heatmap of crime frequency on Georgia Tech's campus. The heatmap is based on the time of day, so it will adjust based on where crimes are most frequent during different times. The application will also attempt to find the safest route from one point on campus to another.
